            <p>As an alumni in Applied Physics and an ex-apprenticeship as a metrologist, I have been involved in various projects as much as for work or a hobby. Going from <strong>software development</strong> to <strong>electronics</strong> and <strong>fluid mechanics</strong>. Scroll through the cards below!</p>

                                <p>Using an Arduino Uno, a BME680 sensor, and an OLED display, I built a "Mini Weather Station." The display shows temperature, relative humidity, and air quality. A small icon in the corner (☀) provides a simplified weather forecast based on data from the sensor, calculated using an algorithm that analyzes pressure, temperature, and humidity. This project helped me improve my Arduino skills while learning the basics of weather forecasting.</p>

The idea was that when I left my house for university my parents would have less work to do to take care for Naya.</p>
