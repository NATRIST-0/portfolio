<h2>General Overview</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <p>This Portfolio is designed to showcase the general, professional and technical aspects of my career, particularly as a student in Oceanic, Atmospheric and Climate Sciences, but also my personal interests. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of my skills and experiences.</p>

            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>
                After obtaining my high school diploma in science, I headed to the Applied Physics Bachelor's degree. I wanted to keep my future career wide open thanks to a multidisciplinary degree. I graduated with a <strong>Materials and Physico-Chemical Controls specialization</strong>.<br><br>
                I am now pursuing a <strong>master's degree in Oceanic, Atmospheric and Climate Sciences</strong>, at the University of Toulouse, France.

            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                I have two main hobbies: <strong>mountain biking</strong> and <strong>fishing</strong>!<br><br>
                I've been a mountain biker for the last decade and have consistently ridden my bike every weekend, going on epic rides throughout the south of France and even in America!
            </p>
            <p>
                As for fishing, I started during the pandemic in 2020, and now I go whenever I don’t get the chance to ride my bike. I usually fish for trout or pike.
