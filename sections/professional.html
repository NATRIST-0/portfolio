                                <p>During my apprenticeship at <strong>Evo Metrology</strong>, a laboratory specializing in the verification of measuring instruments, I focused on two COFRAC accreditation processes: one for torque tools and another for temperature chambers. I wrote procedures, designed automated Excel templates for data tracking and analysis, and developed software tools such as <strong>CalculaTorque</strong> and <strong>DROITEREG</strong> to enhance accuracy, traceability, and productivity.</p>
                                <p>I also contributed to sieve verification. COFRAC accreditation for torque was successfully obtained, and the documentation for temperature chambers was completed. These efforts helped the company expand its scope while ensuring high technical standards.</p>

                                <p>During my internship at the <strong>University of Wyoming</strong> I worked on the <strong>Site Aerial Basin Emissions Reconciliation (SABER)</strong> project. This project aimed to address the gap between top-down (direct measurements) and bottom-up (component-based emissions factors) accounting in the oil and natural gas industry.</p>

                                <p>This internship focused on the <strong>development and calibration</strong> of a new drone-based quantification system, ensuring accurate methane, ethane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide quantification. Key tasks included stability characterization, calibration of mass flow controllers, and creating applications for data analysis.</p>
                                <p>System testing demonstrated successful calibrations, with a maximum measurement uncertainty of <strong>5%</strong> attributed to the measurement components. These results support accurate greenhouse gas emissions reporting, contributing to improved environmental accountability.</p>
