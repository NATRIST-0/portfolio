                <div class="skill-item">
                    <h4>Conducting Measurement Campaigns</h4>
                    <p>Plan, execute, and analyze comprehensive measurement campaigns across diverse industrial and research contexts, ensuring precision and adherence to required standards. Developed through practical work during my bachelor's (e.g., Vitamin C quantification project).</p>

                <div class="skill-item">
                    <h4>Applying Metrology and Quality Processing</h4>
                    <p>Implement metrological methods and quality control procedures to maintain reliability, traceability, and compliance in measurement systems and processes. This skill is a must, as a value is meaningless if not paired with an uncertainty.</p>

                <div class="skill-item">
                    <h4>Characterizing Physical and Chemical Quantities</h4>
                    <p>Evaluate and analyze physical and chemical properties of materials using advanced characterization techniques (e.g., Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography - HPLC) to support development, quality control, and innovation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="skill-item">
                    <h4>Defining Measurement Specifications in an Environmental Context</h4>
                    <p>Develop and implement measurement protocols aligned with environmental sustainability objectives, including monitoring and analyzing environmental parameters. Honed through experience with non-destructive testing methods.</p>
